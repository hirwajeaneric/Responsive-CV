                            More than 2500 pieces already created, 50+ sold drawings.
                            I could say, I enjoy it for sure. <br><br>
                            Drawing makes brings calmness and focus to me.
                            I also enjoy the works I make.</p>

                        <p style="padding-right: 60px;">Since I started reading books, 9 years ago, I have read up to 74 books,
                            and I am looking forward to read more. 
                            Reading is one good way to train oneself to focu.
                            Focus is not the only benefit though. 
                            <br> In fact, the more you read,
                            the more you become good at understanding stuffs like concepts, 
                            and even read faster than the average person. <br><br>
                            Note that the highest reading speed is above 3000 words per minutes 
                            when the average person reads around only 800 words per minute.</p>
