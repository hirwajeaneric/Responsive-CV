                        <h1>Writing.</h1>
                        <p>More than anything else, I enjoy and really love writting.
                            I like exposing and organizing my ideas through writting.
                            It clears my mind, and helps me share to the world what I know.
                            I don't know alot, but I believe there is alot to tell though.
                            I am a content creator, a blogger and proof reader.
                            <br><br>

                        Ooh! What can I compare friendship to? <br>
                        A good companionship is the best cure for any thing I can say.
                        When I am with my friends, I wish I could stop the time. 
                        So little time shall you see me socializing. 
                        But Bro, wait until I am hunging with the guys.
                        Everything changes.
